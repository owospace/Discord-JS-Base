## I need support/help! Please?

I do not offer support, I think this should be pretty obvious as to why.
HOWEVER, if you are having issues and you believe my code is responsible:

> Discord
  - My Discord is 'space#0002' without the quotes.
> Email
  - My Email Address is 'me@spce.moe' without the quotes.
